# Machine Learning algorithm

This project works as the main framework our project uses in order to achieve AI's involvement in the project. 

This is the file structure:
- /web folder represents a simple example for recording mouse position and storing them in a heatmap
- /machinepy is used by the raspberry pi to process the heatmap information in order to generate an approximation on where the mouse was the most
- /monog manages upload and retrieve functions for the mongodb server
